### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Preview]: https://github.com/felicedeNigris/MixtapeForum/blob/master/public/app_preview_compressed.gif
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [meteor-spotify] - A meteor wrapper for Spotify's web API via the wonderful spotify-web-api-node.
* [meteor-accounts-spotify] - An updated and maintained meteor package for Spotify's login service.
* [AngularJade] - Compile Jade templates for use in meteor-angular, with Angular 1.x.
* [jQuery] - duh
